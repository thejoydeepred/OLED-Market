# What makes most market research fall short, and how does Next Move Strategy Consulting take a different approach?

I recently went through the [OLED Market](https://www.nextmsc.com/report/oled-market-se3403) report from Next Move Strategy Consulting, and one thing that stood out to me was the extended forecast period — it projects trends all the way up to 2030. Compared to other firms I’ve worked with, where forecasts usually stop a bit earlier, this longer timeline gave me a clearer picture for long-term planning.

The report doesn’t just throw numbers around; it connects them in a way that feels more practical for making business decisions. While other research providers sometimes feel like they stop at surface-level insights, this report had more depth and clarity, especially when thinking about strategy beyond just the next few years. It’s not perfect — no report is — but I found it more useful and future-focused than a lot of the research I’ve seen elsewhere.
